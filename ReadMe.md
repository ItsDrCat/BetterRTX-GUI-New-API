Welcome to BetterRTX Installer GUI! This graphical user interface (GUI) application allows you to install and uninstall BetterRTX, providing an enhanced experience for the installation of BetterRTX. With two different modes, IOBit and Native, you can choose the installation method that best suits your needs.

## IOBit Mode

To use the installer in IOBit mode, follow these steps:

1. Make sure IOBit is properly installed by checking the message displayed on the application's interface. Red messages indicate that IOBit is not found, while green messages indicate that IOBit is found.
2. If IOBit is not found, click on the "Browse" button to manually select the IOBit installer location (ensure it is actually IOBit executable if the location is selected manually).
3. Once IOBit is detected or the location is manually selected, choose the version you want to install from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the "Install" button to begin the installation process.
5. When prompted by PowerShell for permissions, grant the necessary permissions by clicking "Yes" in the PowerShell window.
6. When asked by IOBit, click "Ok" to continue.
7. Wait for the PowerShell window to display a success message, indicating that the installation is complete.

## Uninstalling BetterRTX in IOBit Mode

To uninstall BetterRTX using IOBit mode, follow these steps:

2. When prompted by PowerShell for permissions, grant the necessary permissions by clicking "Yes" in the PowerShell window.
3. When asked by IOBit, click "Ok" to continue.
4. Wait for the PowerShell window to display a success message, indicating that the uninstallation is complete.

## Native Mode

In Native mode, the installer bypasses IOBit and directly installs BetterRTX using the system's native installation method.

1. Choose the version you want to install from the dropdown menu.
2. Click the "Install" button to begin the installation process.
